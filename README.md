# KEVSight

Push Sightings to Vulnerability-Lookup based on data from the
[Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).


## Installation

[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is an easy way to install and run Python applications in isolated environments.
It's easy to [install](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#on-linux).

```bash
$ pipx install KEVSight
$ export KEVSight_CONFIG=~/.KEVSight/conf.py
$ cisa_kev --download-path /home/cedric/.cisa_kev/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json  download
$ KEVSight
```

The configuration for KEVSight should be defined in a Python file (e.g., ``~/.KEVSight/conf.py``).
You must then set an environment variable (``KEVSight_CONFIG``) with the full path to this file.
